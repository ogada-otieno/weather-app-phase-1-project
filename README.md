# Real-time Weather App

## Project Description
### Version
v1.0.0

### MVP / description
Enter a city and see its weather details as outline below. As a user, I can:
1. See the current weather status,
2. See the temperature value in Degrees Celsius,
4. See the weather description e.g cloudy, clear sky, sunny, windy, etc.,
5. See the city and country e.g Nairobi Kenya,
6. Convert the temperature from Celsius to Farenheit when I click on the temperature icon.

## Project Requirements
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. API - [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/current)

## Testing Authentication
Note that the login section is purely a dummy and doesn't achieve much. In order to test the login, the following credentials are used
***username:*** user
***password:*** 1234
Any other credentials will throw an "Invalid credentials" error message
